This chapter will introduce the basic stroking techniques in soft tennis, including forehand strokes, backhand strokes, as well as some common errors and correction methods. Mastering these basic skills is crucial for improving your soft tennis level.

## Forehand Stroke

The forehand stroke is one of the most commonly used techniques in soft tennis. Here are the steps to correctly execute a forehand stroke:

1. **Ready Position**: Stand sideways facing the incoming ball, with your weight slightly forward.
2. **Backswing**: Pull the racket back, with your arm naturally bent.
3. **Contact Point**: Hit the ball at the side-front of your body, keeping your arm straight.
4. **Follow-through**: After hitting the ball, let the racket naturally swing forward and upward.

## Backhand Stroke

Although not as frequently used as the forehand, the backhand stroke is equally important. Here are the basic steps for a backhand stroke:

1. **Ready Position**: Stand sideways facing the incoming ball, with your non-racket hand lightly supporting the racket head.
2. **Backswing**: Pull the racket to the opposite side of your body.
3. **Contact Point**: Hit the ball in front of your body, with your arm naturally extended.
4. **Follow-through**: After hitting the ball, swing the racket towards the target direction.

## Common Errors and Correction Methods

1. **Contact Point Too Far or Too Close**
   - Error: Results in insufficient power or poor control
   - Correction: Practice judging the trajectory of incoming balls and adjust your positioning

2. **Overuse of Wrist**
   - Error: Affects the stability of the stroke
   - Correction: Keep the wrist stable, mainly use arm strength

3. **Unstable Center of Gravity**
   - Error: Affects the quality of the stroke and movement speed
   - Correction: Pay attention to footwork, maintain a stable center of gravity

4. **Taking Eyes Off the Ball**
   - Error: Unable to accurately judge the timing of the stroke
   - Correction: Keep your eyes following the ball's trajectory until contact

By continuously practicing and correcting these common errors, you will be able to gradually improve your stroking techniques in soft tennis. Remember, good fundamentals are key to becoming an excellent soft tennis player.
