Warm-up is a crucial step before any sport, and it's especially important for soft tennis players. This section will explore the importance of warm-up and its impact on athletic performance.

## Preventing Sports Injuries

1. **Increasing Muscle Temperature**
   - Enhances muscle elasticity
   - Reduces the risk of strains and sprains

2. **Improving Joint Mobility**
   - Lubricates joints
   - Decreases the possibility of joint injuries

## Enhancing Athletic Performance

1. **Increasing Cardiopulmonary Function**
   - Gradually raises heart rate
   - Improves oxygen transport efficiency

2. **Enhancing Nervous System Response**
   - Improves neuromuscular coordination
   - Increases reaction speed

## Mental Preparation

1. **Focusing Attention**
   - Helps athletes enter a competitive state
   - Reduces distractions and anxiety

2. **Building Confidence**
   - Establishes confidence through familiar warm-up exercises
   - Prepares mentally for the upcoming match or training

## Basic Warm-up Routine

1. **Light Aerobic Exercise** (5-10 minutes)
   - Jogging, brisk walking, or running in place

2. **Dynamic Stretching** (5-10 minutes)
   - Dynamic stretches for arms, shoulders, waist, and legs

3. **Sport-Specific Warm-up** (10-15 minutes)
   - Warm-up mimicking tennis movements, such as shadow swings

4. **Gradually Increasing Intensity**
   - Progressively increase exercise intensity from light to moderate

5. **Raising Core Body Temperature**
   - Increase core body temperature through high-intensity exercise

6. **Joint Lubrication**
   - Increase joint synovial fluid through exercise to reduce friction
